# IEQ (Indoor Environment Quality) Monitoring Webapp

Capstone project of my Biomedical Engineering Undergrad, and my first full stack project. An IEQ monitoring system is responsible of monitoring an indoor environment through a device while storing and displaying collected data for review on a webapp. In this case, I handled https communications between the device and the server, storing collected data about the environment in a MySQL database. I then ensured data is displayed and graphed correctly, by implmenting asynchronous communication between the server and the client mainly through FETCH API, while using Highchart.js for the graphing part. This ensured the user gets a comprehensive view of an indoor space's environment changes through time. The project served as a good introduction to web development, and has greatly expanded my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS and network communication between the different stacks of a web app.
